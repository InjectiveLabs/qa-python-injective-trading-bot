## 🚀 Quick Start (From Zero to Hero)

### 📋 Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+** (because we're not living in the stone age)
- **Injective testnet wallets** with INJ tokens (get them from the faucet)
- **Virtual environment** (keeps your system clean like a good crypto hygiene)

### 🛠️ Installation (The Setup of Champions)

1. **Clone and Setup** 🏗️
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd qa-python-injective-trading-bot
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure Your Wallets** 🔐
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your wallet private keys (keep them secret!)
```

3. **Set Up Your Wallet Configuration** 💰
Edit your `.env` file with your wallet details:
```bash
# Wallet 1 - The Primary Market Maker
WALLET_1_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_1_here
WALLET_1_NAME=Primary Market Maker
WALLET_1_ENABLED=true
WALLET_1_MAX_ORDERS=5
WALLET_1_BALANCE_THRESHOLD=100

# Wallet 2 - The QA Market Maker  
WALLET_2_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_2_here
WALLET_2_NAME=QA Market Maker
WALLET_2_ENABLED=true
WALLET_2_MAX_ORDERS=5
WALLET_2_BALANCE_THRESHOLD=100

# Wallet 3 - The QA Market Taker
WALLET_3_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_3_here
WALLET_3_NAME=QA Market Taker
WALLET_3_ENABLED=true
WALLET_3_MAX_ORDERS=5
WALLET_3_BALANCE_THRESHOLD=100
```

4. **Configure Markets** 📊
Edit `config/markets_config.json`:
```json
{
  "markets": {
    "INJ/USDT": {
      "testnet_market_id": "0x0611780ba69656949525013d947713300f56c37b6175e02f26bffa495c3208fe",
      "mainnet_market_id": "0xa508cb32923323679f29a032c70342c147c17d0145625922b0ef22e955c844c0",
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "spot",
      "deviation_threshold": 5.0
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Launch the Bot** 🚀
```bash
# Start multi-wallet trading (the main event!)
python3 scripts/multi_wallet_trader.py

# Cancel all orders (emergency stop)
python3 scripts/batch_cancel_orders.py
```

## 🎮 How It Works (The Magic Behind the Curtain)

### 🔄 Trading Cycle
1. **📊 Price Check** - Bot checks testnet vs mainnet prices
2. **🎯 Decision Time** - If price difference > 2%, it's time to make money!
3. **🎪 Order Placement** - Creates rich orderbook with randomized orders
4. **⏰ Wait & Repeat** - 10-second cooldown, then repeat the cycle

### 💰 Price Correction Logic
```
Testnet Price: $12.8180
Mainnet Price: $12.6645
Difference: 1.21% (within 2% threshold)
Action: ⏸️ Monitoring only (no trades needed)

Testnet Price: $13.5000  
Mainnet Price: $12.6645
Difference: 6.58% (above 2% threshold)
Action: 🚀 PLACE ORDERS TO CORRECT PRICE!
```

### 🎲 Order Sizing (The Art of Looking Natural)
- **Range**: 0.1 to 10.0 INJ per order
- **Options**: 23 different size variations
- **Strategy**: Randomized sizes to avoid detection
- **Result**: Orderbook that looks totally organic
