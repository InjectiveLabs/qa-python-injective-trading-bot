**Subject:** Docker Compose Implementation - Trading Bot System | Need Input on Architecture

---

Hi [DevOps Team],

I'm working on dockerizing our trading bot system based on your suggestion to use Docker and Docker Compose. Before we implement, I want to align with you on the architecture and requirements to ensure we do this the right way and follow your standards.

## 📋 Quick Context

**What the system does:**
- Web dashboard where users can start/stop trading bots
- Each bot trades on behalf of a specific wallet and market combination  
- Users dynamically choose: Wallet + Market + Bot Type → Click "Start"
- Currently uses Python subprocess management, needs to adapt for Docker

**Current scale:**
- 3 wallets, growing to 6+
- 2-3 markets per wallet (INJ/USDT, TIA/USDT, derivatives)
- Typically 3-6 bots running concurrently
- Small team access (5-10 people)

**Why Docker:**
- Better isolation (one bot crash doesn't affect others)
- Easier deployment and updates
- Standardized infrastructure
- Your team's preference 👍

## 🏗️ Proposed Architecture

I've documented the proposed architecture here:
📄 **`docs/DOCKER_ARCHITECTURE.md`** (attached/in repo)

**Key points:**
- 1 web dashboard container (always running)
- Multiple bot containers (created dynamically when users click "Start")
- Shared volumes for logs and configuration
- Docker Compose for orchestration

**Visual diagram included in the doc** showing container relationships, data flow, and user workflow.

## ⚠️ Critical Decision Points

Before we proceed, there are some architectural decisions that need your input:

### 1. **Docker Socket Access** 🔴 Important
The web dashboard needs to control Docker to start/stop bot containers. This requires mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` into the web container, which gives it full Docker control.

**Options:**
- A) Direct socket access (simple, less secure)
- B) Docker socket proxy (more secure, restricts API)  
- C) Pre-define all bots in compose file (no socket access, less flexible)

**What's your preference from security standpoint?**

### 2. **Secrets Management** 🔐 Important
We have wallet private keys that need to be secured. Currently in `.env` file.

**What's your standard practice?**
- .env file on server?
- Docker secrets?
- External secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)?
- Your existing solution?

### 3. **Persistent Storage**
Logs and config files need to persist across container restarts.

**Preferred approach?**
- Bind mounts (direct filesystem access)?
- Named volumes (Docker-managed)?
- Where should data live on the server?

### 4. **Deployment Method**
**How should updates be deployed?**
- Manual (git pull, docker-compose up)?
- CI/CD pipeline (which tool)?
- You handle it (we just provide files)?

## 📝 Detailed Questions

I've prepared a comprehensive questionnaire covering:
- Infrastructure requirements
- Network and security
- Monitoring and operations  
- Compliance and access control

📄 **`docs/DEVOPS_QUESTIONS.md`** (attached/in repo)

**Priority questions:** Q4, Q5, Q7, Q9, Q10, Q11 (marked in doc)

## 🎯 What I Need From You

1. **Review** the architecture diagram (DOCKER_ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. **Answer** the critical questions (especially Q4, Q5, Q7, Q9, Q10)
3. **Infrastructure details:**
   - Which server/environment will this run on?
   - Is Docker already set up?
   - How should we access it (domain/IP)?
4. **Timeline** - when do you need this deployed?

## 💬 Sync vs Async?

**Option 1:** I can review the docs and answer async (probably faster for you)  
**Option 2:** 30-min call to walk through and discuss (might be clearer)

Whatever works best for your team!

## 📅 Timeline (After Alignment)

Once we finalize the approach:
- **Day 1-2:** Implementation (Dockerfiles, compose file, code updates)
- **Day 3-4:** Local testing
- **Day 5:** Deployment to your infrastructure + testing
- **Day 6:** Handoff and documentation

Total: ~1 week from alignment to production-ready

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **You:** Review architecture and provide answers to questions
2. **Me:** Implement based on your requirements  
3. **Together:** Test and deploy on your infrastructure
4. **Me:** Provide documentation and runbook for your team

## ❓ Questions?

If anything is unclear or you need more context, just let me know. Happy to provide more details or adjust the approach based on your feedback.

Thanks for your help with this! Looking forward to your input.

**P.S.** If the architecture seems too complex or doesn't fit your infrastructure, I'm happy to simplify or adjust. Just want to make sure we build this the right way for your environment!
