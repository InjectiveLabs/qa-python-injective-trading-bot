Simple Multi-Wallet Parallel Trader for Injective Testnet
Runs multiple wallets in parallel for spot market trading

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
- Connects to Injective testnet
- Uses 3 different wallets to place trading orders
- Compares prices between mainnet (real prices) and testnet (fake prices)
- If testnet prices are wrong, it places orders to fix them
- Creates lots of small orders to make the orderbook look busy and natural
